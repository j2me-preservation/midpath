    <title> The Avetana Bluetooth JSR82 implementation
    </title>
  </head>
  <body bgcolor="white">

  This package provides an implementation of the JSR 82 specification from Sun Microsystems (c).
  The aim of this specification is to easily develop Bluetooth-based applications in java. It
  does not exist (as I am writing these comments) any universal implementation of the Sun Specification.
  <br>
  The Avetana Bluetooth package is available under three operating systems: Linux (GPL version), Windows
  and Mac OS X (commercial versions) and is NOT a 100 % pure Java implementation. The use of JNI technologies
  allows to communicate with the hardware and system-specific bluetooth stack.
  <br>
  Under Linux you must have a kernel version &gt; 2.4.20 or at least you must have the BlueZ kernel modules
  installed AND loaded.

    For overviews, examples, guides, and tool documentation, please see the API documentation
    and the documents stored in the directory named "doku".
    <br> The class de.avetana.bluetooth.JSRTest2 gives an overview of the possibilities offered by this
    implementation.
    <br>Please refer to the following tutorial, too.

  <h2>Quick Tutorial</h2>
  <h3>Management of the local Device</h3>
  The JSR82 Specification allows to work only with one Local Device, which is accessible with the help
  of the static method:<br><br>
  <code>LocalDevice m_local=LocalDevice.getLocalDevice();</code><br><br>
  <br><br>

  You can now retrieve some properties of your local device:<br><br>
  <code>
    <i>//retrieves the BT address of the local device</i><br>
    LocalDevice.getBluetoothAdress() <br><br>
    <i>//retrieves the name of the local device</i><br>
    LocalDevice.getFriendlyName() <br><br>
    <i>// retrieves the discoverable mode. Beware, this method often requires root privileges</i><br>
    LocalDevice.getDiscoverableMode()  <br><br><br>
  </code>

  The method <code>getRecord(ConnectionNotifier)</code> and <code>updateRecord(ServiceRecord)</code> cannot be
  directly used here. <br>
  They suppose that you have already created a service waiting for incoming connections.

  <h3>Device/Service Search</h3>

  With your <code>LocalDevice</code> you can retrieve the DiscoveryAgent which will help you to perform an HCI inquiry
  (Device search) or a service Search.
  <br><br><code>
    <i>//retrieves the DiscoveryAgent</i><br>
   DiscoveryAgent m_agent=LocalDevice.getDiscoveryAgent() <br><br>
  </code>
  Whatever the search you want to perforn you need beside your DiscoveryAgent a DiscoveryListener.
  <br>The DiscoveryListener
  will set the way your application react each time a new device or a new service is found, but also when
  the searches terminate normally or abnormally.

  <br><br><b>Example of a device search</b><br><br>
  <code>
   DiscoveryListener myListener=new DiscoveryListener() {<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;public void servicesDiscovered(int transID, ServiceRecord[] servRecord) {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//does nothing<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;}      <br><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;public void deviceDiscovered(RemoteDevice btDevice, DeviceClass cod) {<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("New Device "+btDevice.getBluetoothAddress()+" found!");<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Remote Name of the device is "+btDevice.getFriendlyName(true));<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}catch(Exception ex) {}<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;public void inquiryCompleted(int discType) {<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Device Search completed!");<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br><br>

   &nbsp;&nbsp;public void serviceSearchCompleted(int transID, int respCode) {<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// does nothing<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
 };<br><br>
 try {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;  m_agent.startInquiry(DiscoveryAgent.GIAC, myListener);<br>
    }<br>
    catch(Exception ex) {ex.printStackTrace();}<br><br>
  </code>
  This example does not implement the part of the DiscoveryListener class used to
  manage the result of a service search. In this case this does not have any influence, since
  this little code-fragment is only performing a device search. <br>A more complete example
  performing a service search as soon as the device search is completed can be found
  in the de.avetana.bluetooth.util.ServiceFinderPane class. <br><br>
  I strongly recommand to refer to this class for a pratical example.

  <h3>Client connection and data exchange</h3>

  After a service search and the choice of the service you want to connect to, you
  know the connection URL used to perform a client connection (this URL is given by the
  method javax.bluetooth.ServiceRecord#getConnectionURL(...)).<br><br>

  Let's suppose that the choosen service waits for RFCOMM protocol based-connections. The form of the URL is:<br><br>
  <code>
    String connectionURL="btspp://123456123456:1;encrypt=false;authenticate=false;master=true"
  </code>
  <br><br>
  To connect to this service, assuming that <i>running</i> is a class variable set to <b>false</b>, when
the user presses an UI button labelled <i>Close</i>:<br><br>
  <code>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Connection con=Connector.open(connectionURL);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Runnable r=new Runnable() {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void run() {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byte b[] = new byte[200];<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while (running) {<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dataReceived.setText("Received " + received);<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int a = is.read(b);<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received += a;<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (Exception e) {e.printStackTrace();running=false; }<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>//Starts the thread used to read data</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;new Thread(r).run();<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>//Write some data</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;((StreamConnection)streamCon).openDataOutputStream().writeChars("Try to write");
  </code>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  The JSR82 specification is really an easy-to-use development tool for Bluetooth. Moreover the use
  of the Avetana Bluetooth implementation is transparent for the end-programmer. <br><br>
  This quick tutorial has made a short presentation of the possibilities offered by the Avetana Bluetooth implementation but
  a look at the JSRTest class could complete this HOWTO.<br><br>
  Several turorials are available on the internet and I strongly suggest to consult them if you are not familiar with
  Bluetooth, Java or the use of JSR82. <br>
  But please keep two things in mind:
 <ul><li>Only RFCOMM and L2CAP protocols are currently supported. </li>
 <li>The linux implementation is free under the terms of the GPL. So if you want to modify some files, please
  do it and commit any modifications with our CVS Server.</li></ul>
