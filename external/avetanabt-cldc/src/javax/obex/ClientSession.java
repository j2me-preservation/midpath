/**
 * The <code>ClientSession</code> interface provides methods for OBEX requests.
 * This interface provides a way to define headers for any OBEX operation.
 * OBEX operations are CONNECT, SETPATH, PUT, GET and DISCONNECT.  For PUTs and
 * GETs, this interface will return a <code>javax.obex.Operation</code> object
 * to complete the operations.  For CONNECT, DISCONNECT, and SETPATH operations,
 * this interface will complete the operation and return the result in a
 * <code>HeaderSet</code> object.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>Connection ID and Target Headers</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * According to the IrOBEX specification, a packet may not contain a Connection
 * ID and Target header.  Since the Connection ID header is managed by the
 * implementation, it will not send a Connection ID header if a Connection ID
 * was specified in a packet that has a Target header.  In other words, if an
 * application adds a Target header to a <code>HeaderSet</code> object used
 * in an OBEX operation and a Connection ID was specified, no Connection ID
 * will be sent in the packet containing the Target header.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>CREATE-EMPTY and PUT-DELETE Requests</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * To perform a CREATE-EMPTY request, the client must call the
 * <code>put()</code> method.  With the <code>Operation</code> object returned,
 * the client must open the output stream by calling
 * <code>openOutputStream()</code> and then close the stream by calling
 * <code>close()</code> on the <code>OutputStream</code> without writing
 * any data.  Using the <code>DataOutputStream</code> returned from
 * <code>openDataOutputStream()</code> works the same way.
 * <P>
 * There are two ways to perform a PUT-DELETE request.  The
 * <code>delete()</code> method is one way to perform a PUT-DELETE request.
 * The second way to perform a PUT-DELETE request is by calling
 * <code>put()</code> and never calling <code>openOutputStream()</code> or
 * <code>openDataOutputStream()</code> on the <code>Operation</code> object
 * returned from <code>put()</code>.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>PUT example</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * <PRE>
 * void putObjectViaOBEX(ClientSession conn, HeaderSet head, byte[] obj)
 *     throws IOException {
 *
 *     // Include the length header
 *     head.setHeader(HeaderSet.LENGTH, new Long(obj.length));
 *
 *     // Initiate the PUT request
 *     Operation op = conn.put(head);
 *
 *     // Open the output stream to put the object to it
 *     OutputStream out = op.openOutputStream();
 *
 *     // Send the object to the server
 *     out.write(obj);
 *
 *     // End the transaction
 *     out.close();
