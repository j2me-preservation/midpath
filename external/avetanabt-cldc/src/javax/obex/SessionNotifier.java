/**
 * The <code>SessionNotifier</code> interface defines a connection notifier for
 * server-side OBEX connections.  When a <code>SessionNotifier</code> is
 * created and calls  <code>acceptAndOpen()</code>, it will begin listening for
 * clients to create a connection at the transport layer.  When the transport
 * layer connection is received, the <code>acceptAndOpen()</code> method will
 * return a  <code>javax.microedition.io.Connection</code> that is the
 * connection to the client.  The <code>acceptAndOpen()</code> method also takes a
 * <code>ServerRequestHandler</code> argument that will process the requests
 * from the client that connects to the server.
