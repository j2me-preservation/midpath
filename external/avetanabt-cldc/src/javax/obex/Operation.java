/**
 * The <code>Operation</code> interface provides ways to manipulate a single
 * OBEX PUT or GET operation.  The implementation of this interface sends
 * OBEX packets as they are built.  If during the operation the peer in the
 * operation ends the operation, an <code>IOException</code> is thrown on
 * the next read from the input stream, write to the output stream, or call to
 * <code>sendHeaders()</code>.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>Definition of methods inherited from <code>ContentConnection</code></STRONG>
 * <P>
 * <code>getEncoding()</code> will always return <code>null</code>.
 * <BR><code>getLength()</code> will return the length specified by the OBEX Length
 * header or -1 if the OBEX Length header was not included.
 * <BR><code>getType()</code> will return the value specified in the OBEX Type
 * header or <code>null</code> if the OBEX Type header was not included.<BR>
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>How Headers are Handled</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * As headers are received, they may be retrieved through the
 * <code>getReceivedHeaders()</code> method.  If new headers are set during the
 * operation, the new headers will be sent during the next packet exchange.
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>PUT example</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * <PRE>
 * void putObjectViaOBEX(ClientSession conn, HeaderSet head, byte[] obj)
 *     throws IOException {
 *
 *     // Include the length header
 *     head.setHeader(head.LENGTH, new Long(obj.length));
 *
 *     // Initiate the PUT request
 *     Operation op = conn.put(head);
 *
 *     // Open the output stream to put the object to it
 *     DataOutputStream out = op.openDataOutputStream();
 *
 *     // Send the object to the server
 *     out.write(obj);
 *
 *     // End the transaction
 *     out.close();
 *     op.close();
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * <P>
 * <STRONG>GET example</STRONG>
 * <P>
 * <PRE>
 * byte[] getObjectViaOBEX(ClientSession conn, HeaderSet head) throws IOException {
 *
 *     // Send the initial GET request to the server
 *     Operation op = conn.get(head);
 *
 *     // Retrieve the length of the object being sent back
 *     int length = op.getLength();
 *
 *      // Create space for the object
 *      byte[] obj = new byte[length];
 *
 *     // Get the object from the input stream
 *     DataInputStream in = trans.openDataInputStream();
 *     in.read(obj);
 *
 *     // End the transaction
 *     in.close();
 *     op.close();
 *
 *     return obj;
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * <H3>Client PUT Operation Flow</H3>
 * For PUT operations, a call to <code>close()</code> the <code>OutputStream</code>
 * returned from <code>openOutputStream()</code> or <code>openDataOutputStream()</code>
 * will signal that the request is done.  (In OBEX terms, the End-Of-Body header should
 * be sent and the final bit in the request will be set.)  At this point, the
 * reply from the server may begin to be processed.  A call to
 * <code>getResponseCode()</code> will do an implicit close on the
 * <code>OutputStream</code> and therefore signal that the request is done.
 * <H3>Client GET Operation Flow</H3>
 * For GET operation, a call to <code>openInputStream()</code> or
 * <code>openDataInputStream()</code> will signal that the request is done.  (In OBEX
 * terms, the final bit in the request will be set.)  A call to
 * <code>getResponseCode()</code> will cause an implicit close on the
 * <code>InputStream</code>.  No further data may be read at this point.
