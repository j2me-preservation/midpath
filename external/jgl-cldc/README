INTRODUCTION
============

jGL is a 3D Graphics Library for Java* programming language with an API which
is similar to that of OpenGL**. jGL has not supported all the OpenGL functions,
but the usually used ones. jGL has been re-written for Java2 platform and
compiled by Sun Java2 SDK 1.5.0_09. The development platforms are Sun Soliaris
7/8/9, Microsoft Windows 98/NT/2000/XP, and Linux.

jGL is well known as JavaGL before version 2.2. Because all the Java based
names are registered trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc., JavaGL has been
renamed to jGL since version 2.3 from Dec. 2000.

jGL is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms
of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software

HOW TO COMPILE THE SOURCE CODES
===============================

Before compiling the source codes, please make sure that Sun Java2 SDK has been
installed in the machine and acceptable. Since jGL has been developed on Java2
platform, Sun Java2 SDK, Standard Edition is recommended, and the official web
site is:

	http://java.sun.com/j2se/

Then, download and uncompress the compressed source code file
(jgl-$VERSION.src.tar.gz or jgl-$VERSION.src.zip), the following files and
directories will be in the jgl directory:

README		- this file
LICENSE		- GNU Lesser General Puclic License
Make-config	- configuration file of Makefiles
Makefile	- top Makefile
context		- source codes for core library
glu		- source codes for glu of jGL
glut		- source codes for glut of jGL
glaux		- source codes for glaux of jGL
glj3d		- source codes for Java3D simulation of jGL
gle		- source codes for jGL extension
Example		- examples of jGL
Example-glut	- GLUT examples of jGL
Example-app	- GLUT examples of jGL in Java Application mode
glut-test	- GLUT tests of jGL
Example-gle	- extension examples of jGL
*.java		- source codes

To compile all the source codes, please edit Make-config as necessary to make
sure that the path of Java2 SDK in the local file system are set right. Then,
just make the codes at the top directory of jGL by

	make.

It will make all the source codes, and generate a jgl.jar in the Example
directory. It will also make all the source codes of jGL examples in the
Example directory. Additionally, all the *.html files of jGL examples will also
be used to generate *-pi.html files for Java Plug-in.


HOW TO COMPILE THE SOURCE CODES ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS SYSTEM
===========================================================

For Microsoft Windows System, we strongly recommend to use the same Makefile
under Cygwin, an UNIX-like environment, the official web site is:

	http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

Please remember to select to install "make" when installing Cygwin, because
"make" is not the default install item now. At the same time, please also make
sure that Sun Java2 SDK has also been installed in the machine and acceptable.
After installing Cygwin, it is necessary to link Sun Java2 SDK to the directory
which Cygwin can access it easily. For example, if Sun Java2 SDK has been
installed in C:\j2sdk1.5.0_09, then enter Cygwin environment, execute

	ln -s /cygdrive/c/j2sdk1.5.0_09 /usr/local/j2sdk1.5.0_09

So that to compile the source codes on Microsoft Windows System is the same
as to compile them on UNIX system.

NOTICE: Please strongly check the settings of Make-config, since the default
        settings in that file are for real UNIX systems. Remember to un-mark
        some necessary lines and mark the related ones.


RUN THE EXAMPLES
================

To run the examples, please edit the booktest script (or booktest.bat) file in
the Example (or Example-glut or Example-app) directory to make sure that the
path of Java is correct. Then, type

	./booktest hello (for example)
