/**
 * Instances of the class <code>XdrVoid</code> represent (de-)serializeable
 * voids, which are especially useful in cases where no result is expected
 * from a remote function call or no parameters are supplied.
 *
 * <p>Please note that this class is somewhat modelled after Java's primitive
 * data type wrappers. As for these classes, the XDR data type wrapper classes
 * follow the concept of values with no identity, so you are not allowed to
 * change the value after you've created a value object.
