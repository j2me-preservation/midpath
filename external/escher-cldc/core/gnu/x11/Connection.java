/**
 * Low-level network input/output with X server.
 *
 * 
 * <h3>Flow Control and Concurrency</h3>
 * 
 * From <cite>X11 protocol specification</cite>:
 * 
 * <p>Whenever the server is writing to a given connection, it is
 * permissible for the server to stop reading from that connection (but if
 * the writing would block, it must continue to service other connections). 
 * The server is not required to buffer more than a single request per
 * connection at one time. For a given connection to the server, a client
 * can block while reading from the connection but should undertake to read
 * (events and errors) when writing would block. Failure on the part of a
 * client to obey this rule could result in a deadlocked connection,
 * although deadlock is probably unlikely unless either the transport layer
 * has very little buffering or the client attempts to send large numbers
 * of requests without ever reading replies or checking for errors and
 * events.
 * 
 * <p>Whether or not a server is implemented with internal concurrency, the
 * overall effect must be as if individual requests are executed to
 * completion in some serial order, and requests from a given connection
 * must be executed in delivery order (that is, the total execution order
 * is a shuffle of the individual streams). The execution of a request
 * includes validating all arguments, collecting all data for any reply,
 * and generating and queueing all required events. However, it does not
 * include the actual transmission of the reply and the events. In
 * addition, the effect of any other cause that can generate multiple
 * events (for example, activation of a grab or pointer motion) must
 * effectively generate and queue all required events indivisibly with
 * respect to all other causes and requests. For a request from a given
 * client, any events destined for that client that are caused by executing
 * the request must be sent to the client before any reply or error is
 * sent.
