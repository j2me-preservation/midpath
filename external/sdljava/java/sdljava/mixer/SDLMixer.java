     * This effect will only work on stereo audio. Meaning you called
     * Mix_OpenAudio with 2 channels (MIX_DEFAULT_CHANNELS). The
     * easiest way to do true panning is to call
     * Mix_SetPanning(channel, left, 254 - left); so that the total
     * volume is correct, if you consider the maximum volume to be 127
     * per channel for center, or 254 max for left, this works, but
     * about halves the effective volume.  This Function registers the
     * effect for you, so don't try to Mix_RegisterEffect it yourself.
     * <P>
     * NOTE: Setting both left and right to 255 will unregister the
     * effect from channel. You cannot unregister it any other way,
     * unless you use Mix_UnregisterAllEffects on the channel.  NOTE:
     * Using this function on a mono audio device will not register
     * the effect, nor will it return an error status.

     * @param channel Channel number to register this effect on.
