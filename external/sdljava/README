
This directory is a temporary placeholder for the SDLJava code which was 
modified for the need of the MIDPath project. In the future, we hope that 
the corresponding patches will be included in the SDLJava project.

To compile native code in a standard development environment, just type:
# cd native
# make

Modify the includes in the native/Makefile for more complex environements.
