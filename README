MIDPath README
===============

MIDPath is a project to create a free software implementation of 
the MIDP2 core class libraries.

MIDPath works on top of various graphical libraries (SDL, AWT, SWT, X11)
and audio libraries (SDL, ESD).

MIDPath targets free JVMs working with GNU Classpath:
	* Cacao		(http://www.cacaojvm.org/)
	* Kaffe		(http://www.kaffe.org/)
	* JamVM		(http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/)
	
MIDPath also works with the cldc version of the Cacao VM and so can be seen
as an alternative to phoneME.
	
The Java code is based on phoneME, a free implementation of MIDP2 from Sun.
