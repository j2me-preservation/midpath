MIDPath README
===============

MIDPath is a project to create a free software implementation of the MIDP2 
core class libraries.

MIDPath works on top of various graphical libraries (SDL, AWT, SWT, X11, GTK, 
Qt3/Qt4/Qtopia4, Linux framebuffer) and audio libraries (SDL, ALSA, ESounD, PulseAudio)

MIDPath works with free Java SE environments: JVMs working with GNU Classpath 
(Cacao, Kaffe , JamVM), OpenJDK. It also works with the J2ME/CLDC version of 
the Cacao VM and so can be used as an alternative to phoneME.
	
The Java code is based on phoneME, a free implementation of MIDP2 from Sun.
