MIDPath README
===============

MIDPath is a project to create a free software implementation of 
the MIDP2 core class libraries.

MIDPath targets free JVMs working with GNU Classpath:
	* Cacao		(http://www.cacaojvm.org/)
	* Kaffe		(http://www.kaffe.org/)
	* JamVM		(http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/)
	
The code is based on phoneME, a Sun implementation of MIDP2 which 
is released under GPL.

MIDPath currently uses the SDL and SDLJava libraries as native backend.
